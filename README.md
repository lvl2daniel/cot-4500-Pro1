## Running the Code
To execute the numerical methods:
```bash
python src/main/assignment_1.py
```

This will print the outputs for:
- Approximation Algorithm
- Bisection Method
- Fixed-Point Iteration
- Newton-Raphson Method

## Running Tests
To verify the correctness of the implementations, run:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s src/test
```

Or to run a specific test file:
```bash
python src/test/test_assignment_1.py
```


## Notes
- Ensure you are running the scripts from the project root directory.
